    During my time at UPES I learnt most of my key skills that have I have taken through my career such as teamwork and working to tight deadlines. I thouroughly enjoyed my time at university and learnt a lot about a healthy work life balance.

    I spent a lot of my free time playing games and enjoying the hills of Dehradun and Uttarakhand to the fullest.
